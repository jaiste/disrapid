# disrapid

Disrapid is a discord bot written in python to help content creators connect with their audience and build a sustainable community. It will empower the discord admins to add notifications about newly published content, add moderation features, and add much more. This project currently focusses on YouTube, but I also plan to support other platforms like Twitch and LBRY in upcoming versions.

> Warning: Don’t use this bot on more than ~1000 discords concurrently. This bot currently doesn’t work properly with sharding and discord will disconnect your bot once it reaches the limit of 2.500 concurrent discord guilds. We’re planning to support larger environments in upcoming versions.

## Getting started

> Warning: This project is not released, yet! Once this project is publicly released, you can simply invite disrapid to your discord. 

Disrapids is completely configured with commands directly on your discord with a dot as a prefix.

You can also refer to the command reference in the GitHub wiki

## What about premium?

There are no paid features for Disrapid available and I'm not planning to add such a service in the future. I believe that features should be available to any content creator without limitations and regardless of their income.
